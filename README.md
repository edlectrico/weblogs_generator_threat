# weblogs_generator_threat
This is a copy of the ([weblogs_generator](https://github.com/edlectrico/weblogs_generator)) project. In this case several changes have been made. The idea is to include dangerous IP addresses as a threat to our server. We'll try not only to compare the client IP address with a list of dangerous addresses, but also to analyse any suspicious access (i.e. accessing many times from the same IP address in a few seconds).

The instructions to run the example and the installation notes are available ([here](https://github.com/edlectrico/weblogs_generator/blob/master/README.md))
